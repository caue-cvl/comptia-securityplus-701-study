>  I took the [Security+ certification](https://www.comptia.org/certificacoes/security) from [CompTIA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/comptia), I didn't follow the common path that is study based on the Security+ Ebook  ([Self-Paced Study Guide](https://www.comptia.org/training/books/security-sy0-701-study-guide)). Here is what I did to pass the exam **paying less to learn**.
